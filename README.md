AI-Powered Rail Defect Detection System

This project focuses on building an automated railway inspection system using AI and IoT technologies to detect surface and subsurface rail defects. It uses computer vision and deep learning techniques for identifying cracks and visible faults, along with sensor-based inputs for enhanced detection accuracy. The system is designed for real-time monitoring with GPS-based location tagging and edge deployment, aiming to improve railway safety, reduce manual inspection efforts, and enable cost-effective predictive maintenance.
